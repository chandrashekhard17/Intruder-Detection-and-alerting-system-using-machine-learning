# 👁️ Intruder Detection and Alerting System using Machine Learning

This project is a smart security solution that uses machine learning and computer vision to detect unknown persons (intruders) in a live video feed and raise alerts. It aims to enhance security in real-time by identifying people not in the known dataset and triggering appropriate actions.

---

## 📌 Features

- Real-time video surveillance using OpenCV
- Face detection and recognition using pre-trained models
- Alerts when unknown/intruder is detected
- Easy integration with alarm/notification systems
- Lightweight and runs on a standard webcam and computer

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **Face Recognition (dlib)**
- **NumPy**
- **Machine Learning (KNN or SVM classifier)**
- **Flask (for optional web interface)**

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- pip

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### Run the Detection System

```bash
python app.py
```

## 🎯 How It Works

1. The system captures frames from the webcam.
2. It detects faces in each frame using OpenCV.
3. Recognized faces are compared against the known dataset.
4. If an unknown face is detected, an alert is triggered (console/log/sound/etc.).

---

## 📸 Sample Output

* ✅ Known person: No alert
* ❌ Unknown person: "Intruder Detected!" message (can be extended to sound an alarm or send email)

---

## 🔐 Future Enhancements

* Email or SMS notification integration
* Cloud storage for logs and images
* Real-time dashboard for activity monitoring
* Integration with IoT devices (like smart locks or sirens)
